/*
 * This program demonstrates the concept of **Postconditions** and how they relate to the
 * **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)** in object-oriented programming.
 *
 * - A **Postcondition** is a condition that must be true after a method is executed.
 * - According to LSP, a subclass must be substitutable for its superclass without
 *   affecting the correctness of the program.
 * - Subclasses are allowed to **strengthen** postconditions (i.e., add more guarantees),
 *   but they must not **weaken** them (i.e., break or reduce expected behavior).
 *
 * In this example:
 *
 * - The `Car` class has a `brake()` method with the postcondition: speed must reduce.
 * - The `HybridCar` class (a subclass of `Car`) overrides the `brake()` method.
 *   It not only reduces speed (same postcondition as `Car`) but also increases battery charge.
 * - Since `HybridCar` strengthens the postcondition (adds an extra effect without breaking the original),
 *   it obeys LSP.
 *
 * In `main()`, a `HybridCar` object is used through a `Car*` pointer, demonstrating that
 * substituting `HybridCar` in place of `Car` does not break client code â€” a key idea of LSP.
