// L: Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
// Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types without breaking the program.
//
//  This code follows LSP:
// - `WithdrawableAccount` and `DepositOnlyAccount` are separated.
// - `FixedTermAccount` does NOT inherit `WithdrawableAccount`, so it doesnâ€™t pretend to support withdrawal.
//
//  What if we had only one abstract base class like this:
//     class Account {
//         virtual void deposit(double) = 0;
//         virtual void withdraw(double) = 0;
//     }
//
//  Issue:
// - Then `FixedTermAccount` would be forced to implement `withdraw()`,
//   even though fixed deposit accounts should NOT allow withdrawals.
// - You might write dummy code like:
//     void withdraw(double) { throw runtime_error("Not allowed"); }
// - Now, if some client calls `withdraw()` assuming it always works,
//   it could cause runtime crashes or unexpected behavior.
//
//  This would break LSP because the subclass (FixedTermAccount) wouldn't behave like the base class promises.
