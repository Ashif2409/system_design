/*
 * This program demonstrates the concept of the **History Constraint** and how violating it
 * breaks the **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)** in object-oriented design.
 *
 * üìå History Constraint:
 * If a base class allows certain operations (like `withdraw()`), then the subclass should
 * **not disallow or remove** that operation. Subclasses should not change the expected
 * behavior or allowable state transitions of the base class.
 *
 * üîç In this example:
 * - `BankAccount` has a method `withdraw()` that reduces balance, if sufficient funds exist.
 * - According to the base class contract, **withdraw is always allowed** as long as there's enough balance.
 * - The subclass `FixedDepositAccount` overrides `withdraw()` and **completely disallows it**.
 * 
 * ‚ùå This breaks the history constraint:
 * A `FixedDepositAccount` object is no longer a proper substitute for `BankAccount`,
 * because it restricts an operation that was always allowed in the base class.
 * 
 * üß† Violation of LSP:
 * Client code using `BankAccount*` might expect `withdraw()` to work,
 * but passing a `FixedDepositAccount` instead breaks that expectation.
