/*
 * üß± Interface Segregation Principle (ISP) - SOLID Principle
 *
 * ‚úÖ Principle:
 *   Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use.
 *   Instead of having a large interface for all shapes (2D + 3D),
 *   it‚Äôs better to **split interfaces** based on functionality (e.g., 2D area vs 3D volume).
 *
 * ‚úÖ This example follows ISP correctly by:
 *   - Creating two separate interfaces:
 *       1. `TwoDimensionalShape` with only `area()`
 *       2. `ThreeDimensionalShape` with both `area()` and `volume()`
 *   - Implementing only what each shape needs:
 *       - `Square` and `Rectangle` implement only 2D interface.
 *       - `Cube` implements the 3D interface.
 *
 * ‚ùå What would violate ISP?
 *   If we had a single interface with both `area()` and `volume()`, 
 *   then 2D shapes like `Square` and `Rectangle` would be forced to implement `volume()` unnecessarily.
 *
 * üí° In short, ISP promotes designing small, specific interfaces that are relevant to the client.
